### LinkedIn Auto-Connection JavaScript Automation

#### Usage

1. Go to the connections tab (/mynetwork).
2. Open the browser console.
3. Paste the code from the *bot.js* file according to your local language and press enter.

#### Additional Information

1. The LinkedIn connect button has an ID called "embed" followed by a number. If the console shows that the button was not found, it's normal, as it's searching within a range.
2. LinkedIn has a weekly limit. When alerted, close and reopen the browser or clear the range.
3. Use the tool responsibly, with an interval of 1 to 2 weeks, as LinkedIn can identify the use of external tools.
